I\'ve been struggling with that work decision for weeks, but something about the fresh air and movement helped everything click into place.

I feel so much lighter now that I know which direction to take.\n\nIt\'s amazing how physical movement can unlock mental clarity. I should remember this for future tough decisions.',
